Trying out a few new things

- Yarn instead of NPM
- ES6 (when I remember!) - will keep going back and editing
- MongoDB, Mongoose (first project using it)
- Ajax (framework-free Single Page Application)
- Webpack - probably will remove this, doesn't seem to be needed for this particular app


##
Would be handy to have an app that can
- put students in a random order
- click when students have 'gone'
- put students in random groups (2, 3, 4, 5 - and have options of how to split the groups when there is an uneven number)
- be able to temporarily remove students (because absent that day)
- be able to reorganize random groups (set someone in a larger group because they have to leave early

### Student Randomizer User Stories

- A user will be able to create a cohort
- A user will be able to add students to a cohort
- A user will be able to make a list the students in random order
- A user will be able to see an alphabetical list of students 
- A user will be able to edit a cohort
- A user will be able to delete a cohort
- A user will be able to see a list of cohorts
- A user will be able to edit students
- A user will be able to delete students
